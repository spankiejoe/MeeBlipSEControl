About MeeBlipSEControl

This software can be used to remotely control a MeeBlip SE through MIDI
It also allows you to explore sounds in a easiest way

Extra libraries are needed to get this sketch running :
- ControlP5 by Andreas Schlegel, http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/
- RWMidi by Ruin & Wesen, http://ruinwesen.com/files

All the physical knobs and switches are reproduced in this interface

I also added some extra functionalities :
      You can save and reload up to 32 sounds
      It also allows you to explore sounds through the RANDOM function that you can tune according to your need:
      - You can choose on which parameters the random will apply
      - You can set the range of the random values (for knobs)

There are two packaged versions 
* If you already have a Java 7 installed :

Haven't tested it on Windows and Linux.
Tested it on my MacOSX environment.

Extended testing and feedback welcome.
